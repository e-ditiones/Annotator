# Annotator

This script process segmentation, lemmatization, normalization and NER of XML-TEI encoded files. 

## Getting starded

## TO DO

Normalization and NER are still a work in progress.

### To install Annotator, using command lines, you have to :

* clone or download this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/e-ditiones/Annotator.git
cd Annotator
```

### How to use it

1. The XML-files to be processed need to be in the `in_XML` folder.

2. Run the script
```bash
bash process.sh
```

3. Results are in the `out` folder :
	- `XML` : contains XML annotated files ;
	- `TSV` : contains the annotation in TSV format.

## How it works


### The lemmazition

For lemmatisation, we use [_Pie-extended_](https://github.com/hipster-philology/nlp-pie-taggers) and the "[freem](https://github.com/hipster-philology/nlp-pie-taggers/tree/master/pie_extended/models/freem)" model.
